#Implementing STIMPL
STIMPL is a Turing-complete imperative programming language -- it includes dynamically typed variables, mathematical expressions, (basic) console IO, loops, and conditionals. Though the binding of variables to types is done at runtime (in particular, the time of the first assignment), the language is strongly typed -- type errors are always detected! STIMPL has no scopes and no functions.
